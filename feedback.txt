Hi Amna,

Your home work is well constructed. Your code is readable and rightly documented.
Made good use of the configurations with your simulations. Code has a good amount of unit tests.
Few pointers that could be improved, Every simulation has util methods that almost perform same functionality like reading confs and creating instances.
This could have been moved to a util class/library, made use of one common method/class across the simulations.
This would avoid your repetitive unit tests for each simulations and replaced with just one unit test.
You have given a good description of your results!

You have earned all 7% + 3% = 10%!

Thank you,
Mohammed Siddiq
